// Based on how the languages executes the code we can categorise languages in the following :
// --> Compiled language:A compiled language is a programming language where the source code is translated (compiled) into machine code by a special program called a compiler before it can be executed by the computer's hardware.

//Example: c++

//--> Interpreted language:An interpreted language is a type of programming language where the code is executed line-by-line or statement-by-statement by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.

//-->Hybrid language: A hybrid language refers to a programming language that combines aspects of both compiled and interpreted languages.  
// Example : javascript


//Concept of Boxing:
// Boxing is a phenomenon where it tries to convert a primitive type into an object..

console.log("abc".length);
let x=9;
console.log(x.toString());
console.log(typeof x);
